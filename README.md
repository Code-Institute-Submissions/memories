# Memories game

The game was first created as an idea from the 80's game "Simon Says". It has the same principel as the old original game
where the player must follow a sequence of lights in the correct way to win the game.
The player can use the mouse to pres any of the buttons of the menu sarting with the power button.
For the player to start the game they need to press the power button . By doing this a red sign is going
to be shown in the display screen. This makes understand that the game is on. By giving power to the piano the player
is able to press the "play" button so the sequence is generated. The sequence is shown by lighting the buttons you need to press
with grey color to give the impresion they are clicked and is also followed by a sound unique for each tast. 
It first starts with one tast to be followed and and everytime 
the right tast is presed another one is added. The sequence on the display
starts with 1 for the first level and goes up by one every time you make a 
right move.For the player to win the game they must follow corectly a sequence of 10 tasts . Than by
 fullfilling the games objective you win the game and all the tasts become grey and the game is finished showing
"win" in the display.Than you can pres play to restart the game again.
If the player wants to reset the game he needs to pres the powe buton to turn the game off and presit again to turn the game on and
press play to restart the game.
If a tast is played wrong the game will start again from level 1.

## UX
  The game is in general for avery audience becaouse it does not contain any harmful content or adult content .
  If i would take int consideration four different users and how they may behave when they play the gaem.
1) So first we have a child who is interested to try a game that is a memory game. 
   The designed is made in a way to attract children audience because of the colorful background using the towstory background theme.
   The piano it self is designed to look like an animated object more than a realistic piano . And at last why not to try a chalenge 
   because the game is chalenging.
2)The second user might be an adult who just wants to play a memory game just to pass the time and to train the brain.
  Usuali memory games are a bit tiring thats why a calm background music ha been used to make you relax while you are playing the game.
  Ofcourse there is even the option to mute if you don't want to fall asleape.
3)An artist that likes music. The game is conected to realistic sounds of the piano . Any tast pressed playes a sound like a real piano
would do.So for a person who likes music can be something in advantage because he can follow the sound two played when the sequence is
is played not follow only the color.
4)And a t last why not a developer. I mean i myself searched a lot to get the right idea of the game i had in my brain and how to
 realise it.
 So this might be an help for someone who can use it on his own projects.And a good idea how to turn an classic game into something new.





## Design process
The first idea of the page is shown on the wireframes:

![83f5d0a6-599e-494a-a575-46dc50e1706f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63249988/99462827-65506700-292c-11eb-91ab-1a4efc48abdd.jpg)


The original page now it is been build by taking as example the  wireframe.
This is the view on the desctop.

The page is for all the audience it doesn't contain any restricted material or mature content.


Colour Scheme
I through to use more the background image as a warm and happy color but besides the open blue and white for the clouds
a worm brown to orange color has been used to give to the paino that look of an animated one.
Darkred is beeing used for the numbers of the levels in teh display.
And black for the tast and white for the eyboard.


Typography

The main font family used is "Roboto" for the buttons and  "Dancing Script" for the title.



## Features
The page is been programed to work in 3 different screen sizes.
1)PC
2)Tablet
3)Smartphone
The elements are responsible designed to suit the changes made to the screen.

"Power Button" - the first of the buttons that whithout pressing it you can only turn the volume on and off.
It is being designed to give a more realistic meaning to the piano. So you press the power button the display has power now and 
it can show numbers and the piano can be played.You can pres it anytime during the game to reset the game and start form the beggining.


“Level Display” - a clear display to show users which level they have reached, 
the number on the display also corresponds to how many lights will flash at each level. 
This helps the user track the current level they are on and particularly helps user two as they can track their high scores.
 
 "Play Button" - after the display button you have the play button . That when pressed it the sequece starts.

 "Sound On", "Sound Off"- The background music plays automaticly when the page loads but you can use sound off to mute the background
 music and sound on to unmuted it.

 //Features to add//
 I could create some levels more difficult and make the player fill a whole sequence since the level one and allow 3 mistakes .
 So if he fails three times he would not have to start the game all over again but he will be taken one level back each tme he fails.

## Technologies Used

Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS


Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Bootstrap 4.4.1:
(Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.)

Font Awesome:
(Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.)

Git
(Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.)

GitHub:
(GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.)
/*--Html---*/
The piano main object of the game has been created using html.
Divs have been used to for the grouping of diferent sections.
Buttons are used the most for the piano's keyboard and for the menu buttons.
/*--CSS---*/
Every element than has been modified using css.  I styled each section using similar logic
 so that the game was symmetrical and well proportioned. 
It is also useful to make sure the same styling is used across the application to make sure it is consistent.
/*--JS---*/
Javascript is used to add the dynamic elements to the application, such as the sequencing which is based on picking a
 number between 0-17 “(Math.random())”, multiplying that by 4 “(* 16)”, adding one and then rounding the number to the nearest integer ”(Math.floor)”.
 The Javascript then runs this algorithm 20 times to match the level requirements.
This is seen as: for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) { order.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1); }
Java has also beeing used to make condition how the game will behave if the Menu buttons are pressed or not.
Another future addet with java is the background music for wich a loop has been created so it can start again every time finishes.


## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator Services and Esprima were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

W3C Markup Validator results: Document checking completed. No erros or advisories shown.
W3C CSS Validator results: Congratulations! No Error Found.
Esprima for the Js shows result :Code is sintactically valid.

Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section.

As first time visitor :
 I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site .

 1) As you enter the page it's design itself makes the perpose of the page clear.
    The layout itself gives you 4 options  .
 - click power to give power to the game and start the display.
 - click play to start playing the game and to begin the sequences.
 - click mute volume to mute the background music.
 - or click unmute to unmute the background music.
 2) I don't want to go to a point that i don,t know where to go anymore and get stucked.
     There is always the power button so you can reset the game eny time you want.
 3) I want a simple game that is also interesting.
    The fact that is a piano version of Simon Says game its interesting from the begginign.

## Further Testing
1)The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.
2)The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7,Moto g4, Galaxy S5,Google pixel 2 and 2xl,
 ihone 5 and se, ipad , ipad pro, ihone x, iPhone 8 iphone 6 and ipad using the developer tools.
3)A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
4)The code has been tested with W3C css validator and W3C html and Esprima validetor to check for errors.
By the results gotten it does not show any problems.

Here are the results shown by the validators.

5) The page has been tested using the dev toos to resolution 450px x 560px, 750px x 560px and 812px x 745px 
so landscape and portrait and on ipad resolution 1024px x 768px 
and 820 x 1024 also landscape and portrait.

The problem that the page had was related to the sequence of the Js logic. 
Aparently at some point there would be occasions where the browser would lose the sequence and start flashing random lights.
Once I had implemented the user controls this stopped. Before implementing the user controls, the computer would not have a reason to pause its sequence and,
as a result, would just run through its pre-set sequence of numbers, causing flashes to occur without any user input.
Once the user input had been added in, the game had a greater degree of control as the code was forced to stop so that the user could take their turn.
Another Problem that is still running is on safari the page loses some of the compatibility and you cant hear the background music and 
the sequence when it's played plays without music onli flashes lights.This problem is not showing on the google chrome so i thing its
some king of broswer compatibility isue.
Another problem that i had was the. "Showing favicon missing error 404 on JS"
This went away when i added this link <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/styles.css" /> to the head of the HTMl.
The page has been tested on iphone 7 and 11 and it can be seen that runs a bit slower than the normal pc tests.
## Known Bugs
Not playing background music on safari broswer.
Not playing sounds when the sequence plays in safari broswer.
Page runing a bit slow on the iphoene tests.

 

## Deployment
Platform used to deploy the project is Github through github pages.
Used git add to add files and after that git commit to coment the files addeted and deleted and git push 
at the end to move the files to the github pages.
url that the page is hosted is  https://kristi0403.github.io/memories/
